# minus

The intention of minus is to give all of us a greater sense of control in our online experiences. 

We, as individuals, should have the ability to choose our associations and the content we are exposed to. 

One of the first projects in this space is a generic Twitter blocking utility. 
It takes a lot of inspiration from the https://github.com/ceceradio/twitter-block-chain project.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Fair warning : This script will automatically block based on a list of followers. It is not particularly intelligent or efficient.
There are MANY people who do not necessarily follow others based on an agreement of ideals but rather out of professional obligation.
Specifically, members of the press come to mind.
This script will end up causing the user to block broader than intended and currently requires manual intervention to recognize and unblock as necessary.

Enhancements welcomed, rando complaints not as much. üòé

Use with caution.
